##IBM is facing an attrition problem and would like to understand which features are impacting attrition the most.

##What steps can be taken to reduce Employee Attrition and stop employees on their way out?

##The target variable was "Attrition", whether or not an employee had left the company. There were 1470 rows and 35 columns in the original dataset

##Several models were developed. First, all models were generated manually. After this initial model development, the Python library PyCaret was used. This allowed for a quick and easy comparison of the data against all models. 

##The 8 Models generated are as follows: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Neural Network, K-Means Clustering and Gradient Boosting Classifier.
